## What is Software Configuration Management?
Software configuration management (SCM) is the process of tracking and recording changes made to software to ensure high software quality and development efficiency. 

## How does GitHub help with SCM?
GitHub helps with this by allowing you to create a repository that contains project files, which can then be pulled, edited, pushed, and merged to systematically manage changes to a software project.
