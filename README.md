# SCM-Practice-Lopez
A README.md file that briefly explains what SCM is and how GitHub helps with it.
Software configuration management (SCM) is the process of tracking and recording changes made to software to ensure high software quality and development efficiency. GitHub helps with this by allowing you to create a repository that contains project files, which can then be pulled, edited, pushed, and merged to systematically manage changes to a software project.
